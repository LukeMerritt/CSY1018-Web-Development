        <p>As previously mentioned I am Luke! A Computer Games Developer and Co-Founder of FV Studios, a small company responsible for small educational games in Actionscript 3.0 and 3D art galleries within the Unity engine. I am a keen programmer and father of two, meaning I find myself with no spare time. I have not only worked on my own development of games but also within companies as a manager like Retro-Computers Ltd on the ZX Vega, a I.T teacher to first time computer users, a spot welder, an airframe engineer and a personal trainer. I like to believe my time within engineering perfects my work on projects working in conjunction with my perfectionist traits which can ofter be a hinderance.</p>
