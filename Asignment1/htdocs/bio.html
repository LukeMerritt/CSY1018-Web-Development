        <p>As mentioned previously, my name is Luke Merritt. I am a first year Computer Games Developer studying at the University of Northampton. I am also the co-founder of FV Studio, a small games company that have previously worked in the educational games sector, as well as on the ZX Vega project. I am also an ex-aircraft engineer and sheet metal fabricator which all play a vital role to the quality of work I produce. In terms of home life I am left with little free time as I am a father of two children; Alfie and Elsie Merritt. I used to be a personal trainer when I was younger and even looked into a career along those lines.</p>
